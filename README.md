# RSA Quantum Decryption - abcapstonefa25istTeam1
Team Members: Alex Hammond, Ali Almalky, Madisyn Brandt, Giovanni DiBacco

## Project Overview
  This GitHub repository will consist of the Team's effort to create a Qiskit circuit for decryption of a simple form of RSA. With in it will contain the files we used to compare and test the functionality of our circuit along with logging the test results when we begin testing.

## Repository Layout
- ClassicalShor'sAlgorithm.py
- QiskitShor'sAlgorithm.py
- QiskitShor'sAlgorithmEXAMPLE.py
- README.md
- SimpleRSAGeneration.py
- TestingLogs.txt

### File Explanations
**ClassicalShor'sAlgorithm.py**
- Simple Shor's Algorithm program to work with classical computing to be used to verify the Qiskit code

**QiskitShor'sAlgorithm.py**
- The main file for the Qiskit circuit that the team will work on

**QiskitShor'sAlgorithmEXAMPLE.py**
- A publically available hardcoded version of Shor's aglorithm with Qiskit to learn and expirement on

**README.md**
- Overview of the project along with important information

**SimpleRSAGeneration.py**
- Meant to act as a way to easily test both the classical shor's algorithm and the one our team will create with Qiskit

**TestingLogs.txt**
- Will store the values when testing classical and/ or our team's custom Qiskit circuit to compare and learn from
